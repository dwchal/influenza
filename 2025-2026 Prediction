### Australia 2025 Influenza Season



### Vaccinations
| Component | 2024–25 (Egg-based) | 2024–25 (Cell/Recombinant) | 2025–26 (Egg-based) | 2025–26 (Cell/Recombinant) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A(H1N1)pdm09** | A/Victoria/4897/2022-like | A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like | A/Victoria/4897/2022-like | A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like |
| **A(H3N2)** | A/Thailand/8/2022-like | A/Massachusetts/18/2022-like | **A/Croatia/10136RV/2023-like** | **A/District of Columbia/27/2023-like** |
| **B (Victoria lineage)** | B/Austria/1359417/2021-like | B/Austria/1359417/2021-like | B/Austria/1359417/2021-like | B/Austria/1359417/2021-like |

**Notes:** Both seasons are **trivalent** (no B/Yamagata component). **Only the H3N2 component changed** from 2024–25 → 2025–26.





For 2025–26 in the U.S., **vaccines are trivalent** (reflecting the ongoing absence of B/Yamagata) and include:
- **H1N1:** A/Victoria/4897/2022-like (egg) or A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like (cell/recombinant)
- **H3N2:** A/Croatia/10136RV/2023-like (egg) or A/District of Columbia/27/2023-like (cell/recombinant)
- **B (Victoria lineage):** B/Austria/1359417/2021-like  
    (WHO recommendation in Feb 2025; FDA and CDC aligned updates in March/August.)




# CDC Outlook 2025–26 Flu Season Summary
[CDC Outlook](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/season-outlook25-26.html)

**Bottom line:** CDC expects the **2025–26 influenza season severity to be *moderate*** (based on peak influenza hospitalizations). Back-to-back high-severity seasons are uncommon but still possible in certain age groups.

## Key points
- **Expected severity:** *Moderate* overall across all ages.  
- **Context:** 2024–25 was **high severity**—the first since 2017–18. Consecutive high-severity seasons haven’t been observed in CDC’s quantitative system (since 2003–04), though pockets of higher severity by age could still occur.  
- **Drivers of burden:** Which subtypes dominate (e.g., H3N2 vs H1N1 vs B), population immunity, and **vaccine effectiveness & uptake** will largely determine outcomes.  
- **Prevention impact:** Vaccination substantially reduces hospitalizations; continuing strong uptake is emphasized for risk reduction.  
- **Timing:** National flu peaks typically fall **December–February**; regional variation and overlap with COVID-19/RSV surges can amplify hospital stress.  
- **System-level outlook:** CDC anticipates the **combined** peak hospitalizations from COVID-19, influenza, and RSV will be **similar (±20%)** to last season; influenza was the **primary driver** of last year’s combined burden.

## Practical implications for clinicians & hospitals
- Prepare for a **moderate** flu season but maintain readiness for **higher-severity** scenarios in select age groups or if a more severe influenza subtype predominates.  
- Emphasize **vaccination** (especially older adults and those with comorbidities); watch early-season subtype signals and VE updates.  
- Anticipate **overlap** with COVID-19/RSV activity around **late December–February**, with regional variability.
